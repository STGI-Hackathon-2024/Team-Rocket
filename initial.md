Problem Statement: Build Your Own Observability Platform

You will set up a Kubernetes cluster (using MiniKube) with two applications, a PostgreSQL and a MySQL database, running on your local machine. Your task is to build a monitoring solution that collects logs from the applications running in the Minikube cluster, authenticates them, stores them in a time series database, and visualizes them in a custom dashboard.
